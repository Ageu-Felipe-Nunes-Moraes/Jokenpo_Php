# Jokenpo - Game Against the Computer

This project is an implementation of the classic "Jokenpo" game against the computer, developed in PHP. The game allows the player to choose one of the options and then compete against the computer, which makes its own random selection. The winner of each round is determined based on the traditional rules of the game.

## Features

- **Play Against the Computer:** The player can choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors to compete against the computer.
- **Random Delay:** To simulate the computer's decision-making process, there is a random delay before its choice is revealed.
- **Winner Determination:** The game automatically verifies the winner of each round according to the game's rules.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will see instructions on how to play.
2. You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to your choice: Rock (1), Paper (2), Scissors (3), or Exit (0).
3. After making your selection, the computer will make its own choice following a simulated delay.
4. The result of each round will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or if it was a draw.
5. The game will continue until you decide to exit by entering 0.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that PHP is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the code.
3. Execute the PHP file.
